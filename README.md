# Neural Network from Scratch

This repository contains a neural network built from scratch using Python. The implementation follows the tutorial provided by [Independent Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pauPCy_s0Ok), which guides the process of creating a neural network without relying on external libraries. This hands-on approach helps in understanding the core concepts behind machine learning models.
